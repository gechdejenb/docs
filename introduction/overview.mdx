# The AI-Native Foundation

SkipSetup solves a fundamental problem in modern development: the **"Hallucination Gap"** where AI assistants are brilliant at generating code but blind to your project's architecture, decisions, and history. Meanwhile, developers suffer from **"full-stack fatigue,"** spending weeks on configuration instead of creation.

## The Problem: Abandoned at the Starting Line

Current development tools have a critical flaw: they abandon you after generation. Others decorate the starting line with templates, but SkipSetup builds **the intelligent foundation for the entire race**.

<Note type="warning">
  <strong>The Hallucination Gap:</strong> AI can write code, but without understanding your project's context, it guesses wrong—leading to broken features, integration issues, and wasted time.
</Note>

## Our Solution: Continuous AI Context

SkipSetup is the first AI-native project environment. It maintains **perfect, ongoing context** throughout your project's lifecycle. Your AI assistant doesn't just help you start—it understands your stack, collaborates on changes, and builds with you from first commit to final deployment.

### The .kiro AI Brain

Every SkipSetup project includes a `.kiro` folder that transforms generic AI assistants into project-aware experts:

## How It Works: AI-Aware Development

### For Developers
```bash
# MVP in seconds
npx skipsetup-cli@latest create my-mvp --size small

# Complete SaaS in <90 seconds
npx skipsetup-cli@latest create my-saas --size medium

# Navigate to your project
cd my-saas

# Start Kiro CLI for AI-assisted development
kiro-cli
```

### For AI Assistants (Kiro)
Every project includes a `.kiro` "AI brain" with specialist agents and automated workflows. Use the Kiro CLI to chat with project-aware AI:

```bash
# Start a general chat session
kiro-cli

# Or chat with a specific agent
kiro-cli --agent auth-expert
```

**Example interaction:**
```
You: "add a user profile editor with avatar upload"
Kiro: "I'll help you implement that. First, let me analyze your current schema..."
```

### The .kiro Folder Structure
```
.kiro/
├── agents/              # Pre-configured AI specialists
├── specs/               # Project specifications
├── steering/           # Architecture documentation
├── hooks/              # Development automation
├── mcp/                # AI tool integration
└── README.md           # Context overview
```

**The result:** Developers start coding features immediately. AI adds new capabilities—like a subscription dashboard—with zero hallucinations, perfectly integrated on the first try.

## Development Workflow with Kiro CLI

### Interactive Feature Development
```bash
# Start your development environment
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, start Kiro CLI
kiro-cli --agent fullstack-specialist

# Give direct instructions
# Example: "add a user profile editor with avatar upload"
# Kiro will provide complete implementation steps
```

### Agent-Specific Assistance
Each agent specializes in different aspects of your project:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Agent</th>
      <th>Specialty</th>
      <th>Example Instructions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>auth-expert</strong></td>
      <td>Authentication & Security</td>
      <td>"add Google OAuth login"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>database-architect</strong></td>
      <td>Database Design</td>
      <td>"add audit logging for user actions"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>fullstack-specialist</strong></td>
      <td>End-to-End Features</td>
      <td>"build a user dashboard with metrics"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>ui-specialist</strong></td>
      <td>User Interface</td>
      <td>"design a responsive admin panel"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>payment-integrator</strong></td>
      <td>Payment Systems</td>
      <td>"add monthly subscription plans"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Complete Development Flow
```bash
# 1. Create your project
npx skipsetup-cli@latest create my-app --size medium

# 2. Navigate and set up
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm db:push

# 3. Start development server
pnpm dev

# 4. Use Kiro CLI for AI assistance
kiro-cli --agent database-architect
# Instruction: "add a user profile editor with avatar upload"
# Kiro provides step-by-step implementation
```

## Kiro CLI Reference

For complete Kiro CLI documentation and available commands, visit:
[https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/chat/](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/chat/)

Basic usage:
```bash
kiro-cli                    # Start interactive chat
kiro-cli --help            # Show help menu
kiro-cli --agent agentname # Chat with specific agent
```

## Real-World Success Story

<Card icon="case-study">
  <strong>Kiroween Demo: Haunting SaaS</strong>
  <p>During the Kiroween Hackathon, a team built a complete SaaS platform using SkipSetup and Kiro CLI:</p>
  
  ```bash
  # Generated the complete project
  npx skipsetup-cli@latest create haunting-saas --size medium
  
  # Used Kiro CLI for guided development
  kiro-cli --agent payment-integrator
  # Instruction: "add subscription tiers"
  # Received: Step-by-step Stripe integration
  
  kiro-cli --agent ui-specialist
  # Instruction: "design an admin dashboard"
  # Received: Complete dashboard implementation
  ```
