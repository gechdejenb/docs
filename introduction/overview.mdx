# The AI-Native Foundation

SkipSetup solves a fundamental problem in modern development: the **"Hallucination Gap"** where AI assistants are brilliant at generating code but blind to your project's architecture, decisions, and history. Meanwhile, developers suffer from **"full-stack fatigue,"** spending weeks on configuration instead of creation.

## The Problem: Abandoned at the Starting Line

Current development tools have a critical flaw: they abandon you after generation. Others decorate the starting line with templates, but SkipSetup builds **the intelligent foundation for the entire race**.

<Note type="warning">
  <strong>The Hallucination Gap:</strong> AI can write code, but without understanding your project's context, it guesses wrong—leading to broken features, integration issues, and wasted time.
</Note>

## Our Solution: Continuous AI Context

SkipSetup is the first AI-native project environment. It maintains **perfect, ongoing context** throughout your project's lifecycle. Your AI assistant doesn't just help you start—it understands your stack, collaborates on changes, and builds with you from first commit to final deployment.

### The .kiro AI Brain

Every SkipSetup project includes a `.kiro` folder that transforms generic AI assistants into project-aware experts:
