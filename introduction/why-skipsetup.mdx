# Why Choose SkipSetup?

Building full-stack applications today comes with significant challenges that waste time, introduce risk, and delay shipping. SkipSetup addresses these fundamental problems with a purpose-built solution.

## The Pain Points of Modern Development

### 1. The Setup Time Tax

  <div>
  **Traditional Approach:**
  - 1-2 weeks configuring infrastructure
  - Hours researching best practices
  - Days integrating authentication
  - More time setting up databases, payments, monitoring
  </div>
  <div>
  **With SkipSetup:**
  - **90 seconds** to generate a complete project
  - Best practices built-in
  - All integrations pre-configured
  - Start coding features immediately
  </div>
</Columns>

### 2. Architectural Anxiety
> "Should I over-engineer for future scale or under-engineer for speed?"

This dilemma leads to:
- **Over-engineering small projects:** Wasting time on unnecessary complexity
- **Under-engineering growing projects:** Technical debt that's expensive to fix
- **Inconsistent decisions:** Different patterns across projects

SkipSetup solves this with **purpose-built scales** that match your project's needs from the start.

### 3. The AI Hallucination Problem

  AI assistants generate code but lack understanding of your specific project's architecture, decisions, and history. This leads to broken features, integration issues, and wasted time fixing AI-generated mistakes.

### 4. Production Readiness Delays
Getting from "it works on my machine" to production-ready involves:
- Security configurations
- Deployment setups
- Monitoring and analytics
- Performance optimizations
- Error tracking

These typically get postponed, creating risk and technical debt.

## How SkipSetup Solves These Problems

### Right-Sized Architecture

SkipSetup provides two purpose-built scales:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scale</th>
      <th>When to Use</th>
      <th>Architecture</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Small</strong></td>
      <td>MVPs, prototypes, weekend projects</td>
      <td>Minimal viable architecture</td>
      <td>Ship faster, avoid unnecessary complexity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Medium</strong></td>
      <td>SaaS products, startups, businesses</td>
      <td>Production-ready with everything included</td>
      <td>Scale confidently from day one</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### AI-Native Development Environment

Every SkipSetup project includes a `.kiro` AI context system that transforms generic AI assistants into project-aware experts:

```bash
# What you get automatically
.kiro/
├── auth-expert.json        # Understands your auth flows
├── database-architect.json # Knows your schema
├── fullstack-specialist.json # Sees your entire stack
└── ui-specialist.json     # Knows your design system
